### Keyboard shortcuts

The keyboard shortcuts can be customized in hotkeys settings.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Global__

- Toggle focus on last terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` ``
  - Focus on last terminal: \(unbound; useful if you want separate keys for focus and unfocus\)

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Terminal is focused__

When a terminal is focused, other keyboard shortcuts \(including Obsidian and plugin hotkeys\) are disabled. Only the following keyboard shortcuts work. Thus you can ignore Obsidian complaining about conflicting keys for the following keyboard shortcuts.

- Clear terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K`, `Command`+`Shift`+`K` \(Apple\)
- Close terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`W`, `Command`+`Shift`+`W` \(Apple\)
- Find in terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`F`, `Command`+`Shift`+`F` \(Apple\)
- Toggle focus on last terminal: `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` `` \(same as above\)
  - Unfocus terminal: \(unbound; useful if you want separate keys for focus and unfocus\)

### Theming

Theming is possible. However, there is no user-friendly interface for now.

1. Open the profile editing modal.
2. Click on the `Edit` button labeled `Data`. It should open up a new modal in which there is a large textbox.
3. Notice `terminalOptions` in the text area labeled `Data`. Refer to the [`xterm.js` documentation](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/blob/master/typings/xterm.d.ts#L26) (`ITerminalOptions`) to set the options. Nested objects may need to be used.
4. Save the profile. Changes should apply immediately.

### Profiles

This plugin comes with several profile presets that you can reference.

When setting up a terminal profile, you need to distinguish between shells and terminal emulators. (Search online if needed.) Generally, integrated profiles only work with shells while external ones only work with terminal emulators.

#### Examples

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Shells__

- Bash: `bash`
- Bourne shell: `sh`
- Command Prompt: `cmd`
- Dash: `dash`
- Git Bash: `<Git installation>\bin\bash.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`)
- PowerShell Core: `pwsh`
- Windows PowerShell: `powershell`
- Windows Subsystem for Linux: `wsl` or `wsl -d <distribution name>`
- Z shell: `zsh`

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD036 -->
__Terminal emulators__

- Command Prompt: `cmd`
- GNOME Terminal: `gnome-terminal`
- Konsole: `konsole`
- Terminal (macOS): `/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/macOS/Terminal "$PWD"`
- Windows Terminal: `wt`
- iTerm2: `/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 "$PWD"`
- xterm: `xterm`

### Miscellaneous

This plugin patches `require` so that `require("obsidian")` and other Obsidian modules work in the developer console. It is toggleable as `Expose internal modules` in settings.

In the developer console, a context variable `$$` is passed into the code, which can be used to dynamically change terminal options.

The full API is available from [`src/@types/obsidian-terminal.ts`](src/%40types/obsidian-terminal.ts).

### Troubleshooting

- Is the plugin useful on mobile?
  - Compared to on desktop, it is much less useful. The only use for it for now is opening a developer console on mobile.
- Why do hotkeys not work?
  - If the terminal is in focus, all Obsidian hotkeys are disabled so that you can type special characters into the terminal. You can unfocus the terminal by pressing `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`` ` ``, then you can use Obsidian hotkeys again.
