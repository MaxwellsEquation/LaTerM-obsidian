## Obsidian LaTerM Plugin

This is a fork of [obsidian-terminal v3.17.0](https://github.com/polyipseity/obsidian-terminal) that integrates [LaTerM](https://github.com/MaxwellsEquation/LaTerM) for LaTeX rendering in terminals.

While I wait for Obsidian to approve this plugin for listing on the plugin browser, you can manually install it
using the same manual install directions as specified in the obsidian terminal readme.

### Features

- All the features of obsidian-terminal
- LaTeX rendering using LaTerM
- Inline math with `$...$`
- Display math with `$$...$$`
